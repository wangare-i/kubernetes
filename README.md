# Kubernetes ConfigMaps & Secrets: Why Mounting is Better Than Environment Variables

When managing configurations and sensitive data in Kubernetes, you can either use environment variables or mount ConfigMaps and Secrets as volumes. While environment variables may seem simpler, mounting is often the better choice. Here’s why.

## ConfigMaps & Secrets: What They Solve
A **ConfigMap** stores non-sensitive configuration data like database ports, URLs, and feature flags. A **Secret** stores sensitive information like passwords and API keys.

### Creating a ConfigMap
You created a ConfigMap to store your database port:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-cm
data:
  db-port: "3306"
```

Applying it:
```sh
kubectl apply -f cm.yml
```

Verifying:
```sh
kubectl get cm
```

### Creating a Secret
You also created a Secret for sensitive credentials:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic test-secrets --from-literal=db-port="3306"
```

## Why Mounting is Better Than Environment Variables
### 1. **You Can Update Configurations Without Restarting Pods**
If you inject a ConfigMap or Secret as an environment variable, the value is set only when the Pod starts. Any changes require a Pod restart.

Mounting it as a volume allows updates to be reflected dynamically.

### 2. **Security & Least Privilege Access**
- Mounted Secrets remain in-memory, not written to the container’s environment, reducing the risk of exposure.
- With **RBAC**, you can restrict access to mounted Secrets, whereas environment variables can be accessed by any process in the Pod.

### 3. **Sharing Configurations Between Containers**
Multiple containers in a Pod can access the same mounted ConfigMap or Secret without duplicating environment variables.

## Using Mounted ConfigMaps & Secrets in Deployment
Here’s your deployment YAML, updated to mount the ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sample-python-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector: 
    matchLabels:
      app: sample-python-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sample-python-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: python-app
        image: wangare/python-sample:v2
        volumeMounts:
         - name: db-connection
           mountPath: /opt
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
      volumes:
       - name: db-connection
         configMap:
          name: test-cm
```

After applying:
```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
```

You can verify that the ConfigMap is mounted correctly:
```sh
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
ls /opt
cat /opt/db-port  # Should output 3306
```

For Secrets, the approach is similar:
```yaml
      volumes:
        - name: secret-volume
          secret:
            secretName: test-secrets
```

## Conclusion
Mounting ConfigMaps and Secrets as volumes is the best practice in Kubernetes. It enhances security, allows dynamic updates, and improves flexibility when managing configurations. While environment variables might seem convenient, the risks outweigh the benefits in most cases.
